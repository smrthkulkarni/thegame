## Code Contribution Guidelines for Contributing to this Project

The following steps should be carried out as part of contributing to this repository:
* **Clarify Requirements:**  Create or have a discussion with the co-contributors about what the exact requirements are for the story or the card.
* **Design Reviews:**  Before starting to develop code and making commits, consider having a design review before starting in-depth development on a task. In case there are large changes which require either a major change in the workflow or a new feature, we may want an email discussion regarding it. If required, we may want to discuss it over a meeting with some white-boarding as well.
* **Research Relevant Tech:**  Contributors are envouraged to take time off to research or learn and evaluate possible solutions and trade-offs for any technologies or techniques needed for the task.
* **PR Self Review:**  Before opening a pull request, read through all the changes from the perspective of a reviewer.

### Pull Requests

Submit PR's with the following guidelines in mind:

* **Functionally Correct:** 
* **Two Approvals Required:**  Atleast two approvals are required for the PR to be merged.
* Code approvals should be from developers who have not contributed towards the task (even when the person hasn't actually written the code).
* Code should be fully **unit-tested**, with an eye toward preventing bugs--not just toward upping code coverage. Code should be **tested end-to-end** at least once.
* **Acceptance Tests:**  Attach acceptance test evidence or instructions to the pull request.  This could take the form of sample output or screenshots, for example.
* **Small and Focused:**  Small, focused PR's are easier to understand and review, and issues are more likely to be spotted quickly.
* **Expect Changes:**  Expect at based on code review feedback. We want thorough feedback on every code which gets through to master.
